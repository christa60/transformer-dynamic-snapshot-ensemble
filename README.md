# transformer-dynamic-snapshot-ensemble

This repository is used for applying [Dynamic Snapshot Ensemble](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/e464656edca5e58850f8cec98cbb979b-Abstract.html) algorithm for transformer-based fine-tuning methods. 

We leverage the '''run_glue.py''' pytorch version as our fine-tuning script in HuggingFaceâ€™s Transformer API version 4.14.0.
